# ETA-Notifier-for-Dubai-Desert-Safari
Tour operators of the Dubai Desert Safari are unable to notify tourists about potential delays in the advertised pickup times. This workflow is designed to handle that communication via Whatsapp. Using a free traffic route selection API, it calculates the estimated pickup time and based on an algorithm, it sends a confirmation/delay message.
